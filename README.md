Iphone app written in Swift. 
Of particular use for Ebay sellers or anyone else that needs to wrap an item for posting.
For example, an Ebay seller has sold an item and now wants to wrap the item in cardboard or stiff paper, prior to posting. 
Assuming that the seller does not have a convenient box to put the item in.
This application will enable the seller to calculate how much cardboard/stiff paper that is required. 
The seller just has to input the length, height and width of the article and the application will do the following:
(1) Display a graphic of the covering required.
(2) Display the total amount of covering required to cover the item in millimetres. 
(3) Shows where the covering needs to be bent or creased to allow for folding.
(4) Shows where the covering needs to be cut to allow for the flaps
